# Wheel of Dinner
I made this project because I often check my fridge and look up what I can make based on what is there.
On top of that, I also struggle to decide what to eat when I'm pressed for time.
This app will take in several inputs: meat, carb, and vegetables as the main and essential ingredients 
and take in any other items such as milk and eggs for specific recipes. 

I also want to implement recomendations based on what I have eaten the days before so I can remind myself 
to have a more balanced meal. 

I am currently learning Swift to create this project. These are the resources I am currently using and 
have come across.
